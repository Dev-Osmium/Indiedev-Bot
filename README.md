# Indiedev-Bot
Discord Bot for the Indiedev Club server


## Message from Alex
### Leaderboard
A leaderboard that updates automaticly when someone gets a point (updates the leaderboard message). I want the admin (me) to be able to add points to diffrent people manualy but I also want points to be able to get added aoutomaticly when someone complets a sertain task.
Commands:
- !leaderboard - shows the leaderboard (can only be used by the admin).
- !points - shows the amount of points you have and on what place you are currently on (can be used by anyone).
- !points @user - shows the amount of points the specified person has and on what place they currently are on (can be used by anyone).


###Random indie game
Upon using a sertain command the bot posts the title of a game and a link to the download page. I was thinking that the bot would take the games from itch.io if that would be possible.
Commands:
- !randomgame - posts the name and link to a game (can be used by anyone).
- !randomgame [parameter] - posts the name and link to a game that fits the parameters (can be used by anyone).
Parameters:
I was thinking that it would be cool if you could add a filter to your search. If that would be possible to create. If you would be able to use multiple parameters at once that would be great. Some examples of parameters/filters could be free, rpg, windows and so on.

News
A channel where the bot automaticly posts gaming/game develpoment related news. It posts the title and a link to the news story. Im not sure from what sites its going to take the news from yet but maybe you have some ideas.
